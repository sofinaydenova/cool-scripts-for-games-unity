# cool scripts I use for my games!!
now I'm creating a platformer game with cute characters &amp; content with Unity &amp; C# | you can find all my games here  https://happydoggostudio.itch.io

I'll be adding here helpful scripts occasionaly, while working on game(s) and thinking that they're worth sharing
